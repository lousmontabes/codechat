# codechat
A simple web app to share code in real time.

## How does it work?

1. Create a chatroom. 
2. Choose the name and language.
3. Share the token with whoever you want to have access to your chatroom.

When you receive a token, enter it onto the field at the top of the page and get started.
That's it!
