        <h1>Codechat was made by people with things to get done.</h1>

        <p>Codechat was born in Barcelona, by the hand of computer science students.</p>

        <p>However, if the content is taller than the user’s viewport, then the footer should disappear
            from view as it would normally, resting at the bottom of the page (not fixed to the viewport).</p>

        <p>If you know the height of the footer, then you should set it explicitly, and set the bottom
            padding of the footer’s parent element to be the same value (or larger if you want some spacing).</p>

        <p>This is to prevent the footer from overlapping the content above it, since it is being removed
            from the document flow with <code>position: absolute;</code>.</p>
